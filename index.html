		<h2>
			Course Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			This course explores interactive design. Emphasis will be placed
			on technical fundamentals of both User Experience (UX) and
			User Interface (UI) as well as concept development and the ap-
			plication of Graphic Design fundamentals. The primary medium
			for the course will be web-oriented, but the topics discussed
			translate to other interactive media, such as mobile apps,
			screen-based kiosks, and more.
		</p>

		<p>
			Throughout each unit there will be readings, online tutorials,
			demos, and exercises that will provide overviews of the neces-
			sary skills/knowledge needed to succeed in this class. Critiques
			will serve as an opportunity for you and your peers to present
			your work and receive feedback for further fine tuning.
			The course will be a mix of instruction, usually via discussion or
			technical demonstrations and studio time, which is free time for
			you to work on your projects and receive closer attention from
			the instructor. Important class updates will be communicated
			via email to your UWP address, so please be sure to check your
			email regularly.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this studio we will concentrate on learning fundamental web
			design technologies: HyperText Markup Lanugage (HTML), Cas-
			cading Style Sheets (CSS), and more. There are a huge number
			of platforms and services available to you on the web today:
			WordPress, Wix, Squarespace... the list is very long. HTML and
			CSS are foundational, so no matter what additional web tech-
			nologies you choose, they will always be in the equation—so we
			will work with those tools to allow you maximum flexibility for
			the future.

		<p>
			Upon completion of this course the student should be able to:<br>
		</p>


			<ul>
				<li>Understand web-oriented user interface and user experience design concepts</li>
				<li>Develop conceptual problem solving skills related to user
				interface and user experience design on the web</li>
				<li>Acquire field-related technical proficiency</li>
				<li>Build vocabulary for user interface and user experience
				design</li>
				<li>Enhance critical thinking and analytical skills</li>


		<p>The objectives will be achieved by:</p>



				<li>Completing projects of increasing complexity</li>
				<li>In class & homework exercises</li>
				<li>Analysis & critique one’s own work & then applying that
				skill to the work of others</li>
				<li>Readings, lectures & discussion of readings</li>
			</ul>


		<h2>
			Course Delivery
		</h2>

		<p>
			Our primary meeting method will be in-person. I will make any
			lecture slides and recorded demos available online through
			Canvas following our class meetings. In the event that we
			need to move online, we will meet via Zoom in a synchronous
			fashion, meaning we will meet at the same time as our typical
			in-person meetings. Invitations to any online meetings in Zoom
			will be sent via email.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Course Prerequisites
		</h2>

		<p>
			ART 105 and one of: ART 372; CSCI 130, 145, 241 or MIS 221.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Workload
		</h2>

		<p>
			Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings
			and complete assignments on time. Students will need to
			spend time beyond scheduled work days to complete assign-
			ments and projects.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Office Hours
		</h2>

		<p>
			If you have questions about your work, design, or anything
			else, please send me an email and come to my office hours. If
			my scheduled office hours time does not work for you, please
			send me an email and we will work something out, including
			meeting via Zoom.
		</p>

			<h2>
				Diversity Statement
			</h2>

		<p>
				I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This
				means that our classroom, virtual spaces, practices, and inter-
				actions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and
				the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to
				universal learning.
				It is my intention that students from all diverse backgrounds
				and perspectives be well-served by this course and that the
				diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a
				resource, strength and benefit. Please contact me if you need
				accommodation for a religious event or if you have suggestions
				for ways I can help improve your learning experience in this
				course.
				In this studio, people of all ethnic backgrounds, genders, gen-
				der identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, abilities, and
				socioeconomic backgrounds are strongly encouraged to share
				their rich array of perspectives and experiences. This includes
				correct pronoun usage—I have shared my pronouns in this
				syllabus and I encourage you to do the same.

			<h2>
				Final Exam
			</h2>

			<p>
				There is no final exam for this course, though we will have a
				final exit interview/critique, typically during finals week at the
				scheduled exam time.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Extra Credit
			</h2>

			<p>
				No extra credit will be offered, but you may choose to revise
				and resubmit any project before the end of the semester to imrpove your score.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Grading Scales
			</h2>

		<p>
			All projects will follow the grading system below. You receive
			a number from 0-4 for a series of project requirements: idea
			generation, degree of progress, depth of thinking, and following
			directions and craftsmanship. Your final grade is an average of
			those requirements for each project.<br>
		<p>

	4=A<br>
	3=B<br>
	2=C<br>
	1=D<br>
	0=F<br>

		<p>
			Idea Generation: This is the first step in the design process. I
			am grading you on how you participate in the idea generating
			activities, if you came up with the requested amount of ideas,
			how well they answered the problem of the project, and how
			they developed into the final product.

		<p>
			Depth of Thinking: I am looking at how well you thought about
			the problem and the solutions you were suggesting. Did you
			do research? Did you look at other designs that inspired you?
			How is that reflected in your design solutions? Did you take the
			information you learned in critique and use that to develop
			your idea even further?

		<p>
			Visually Compelling: This is the quality of the final design. Does
			your solution to the design problem meet a level of professional
			standards in the field of graphic design? Did you spend the time
			developing your idea to the best of your ability? Does your com-
			position utilize the fundamental principles of design?

		<p>
			Following Directions & Craftsmanship: I am making sure that
			you followed all the specifications in the project brief. Is your
			project the correct size? Free from typos? Did you meet all the
			deadlines and is the final project completed on time?

		<p>
			Critique Participation: Here I am making sure that you partici-
			pated in critiques. Critique is an essential part of design work,
			both for your own work and helping your colleagues improve
			their work. Did you comment on your colleagues’ work in a
			respectful, constructive way? Did you recieve feedback in a
			respectful, constructive way? Were you able to clearly articulate
			your ideas and rationalize your design choices when speaking
			about your work?
		</p>

			<h2>
				Final Grades
			</h2>

			<p>
				Your final grade will be based on the accumulative project
				grades. Project grades are based on final product, craftsman-
				ship, and participation in critiques. We typically finish between
				3-4 projects in a semester. Projects are graded and averaged
				together for the final grade.
				<p>
				Class attendance is a must.
				<p>
				Late assignments turned in one class period beyond the dead-
				line will be graded down one full letter grade. Projects that are
				turned in later than one class period will not be accepted.
				<p>
				If there is an emergency and you are not able to attend class or
				turn in an assignment on time, please contact me and provide
				documentation.
				<p>
				I think of our new classroom as a working design studio. I
				expect professionalism, timeliness, good communication, and
				above all,  respect for each other. This is necessary for success-
				ful critiques and projects.

			</p>

			<h2>
				Class Attendance
			</h2>

			<p>
				Attendance will be taken at each class meeting. You are allowed
				3 unexcused absences for the semester. Obviously, these are
				unpredictable times and if we communicate, I am sure any
				issues with attendance can be figured out.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Students with Disabilities
			</h2>

			<p>
				I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This
				means that our classroom, virtual spaces, practices, and inter-
				actions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and
				the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to
				universal learning.

				<p>
				Any student with a documented disability who needs academic
				adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me
				during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain
				confidential. Students with disabilities should also contact Dis-
				ability Services in WYLL D175 at 595-2372 or 595-2610. <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/disabilityservices/">https://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/disabilityservices/</a>
			</p>

			<h2>
				Publicity
			</h2>

			<p>
				The Art Department reserves the right to use reproductions of
				student work for promotional purposes, including the universi-
				ty website.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Concealed Carry
			</h2>

			<p>
				Weapons are prohibited in UW-Parkside buildings and all out-
				door events. Anyone found in violation will be subject to imme-
				diate removal in addition to academic and/or legal sanctions.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Unexpected Class Cancelation
			</h2>

			<p>
				If a class session needs to be cancelled unexpectedly due to in-
				structor illness or emergency, the instructor will notify students
				via UWP email. While university staff will try to post cancellation
				signs in the studio or classroom in a timely manner, email will
				be the main platform for notification.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Etiquette
			</h2>

			<p>
				I expect every participant in this class to treat your colleagues
				with respect. This includes use of welcoming, inclusive, en-
				couraging language. Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, irony, and
				sarcasm as they are not easily understood by all students and
				may be misinterpreted.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Academic Honesty
			</h2>

			<p>
				Plagiarism is a serious offense in the design and academic
				community! All ideas, concepts, images, photos, illustration
				and text must be completely original or properly sourced and
				cited. If you have been found plagiarizing you will immediately
				be asked to leave the course and receive an F. Remember, just
				because you find an item on the Internet does not mean it is
				available for you to use. Please refer to UWP Misconduct Policy
				#28 for definitions of academic misconduct and possible sanc-
				tions.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Ranger Community Health and Safety Standards
		</h2>

		<p>
			UW-Parkside has implemented reasonable health and safety
			protocols based on recommendations by public health au-
			thorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These proto-
			cols may change based on prevailing health conditions. As a
			member of our campus community, you are expected to abide
			by the health and safety rules developed in accordance with
			public health guidelines. These standards apply to anyone
			who is physically present on campus, UW-Parkside grounds, or
			participating in a UW-Parkside-sponsored activity:

		<p>
			Masks or face coverings are required indoors in all public areas
			including classrooms and labs, regardless of vaccination status.
			Masks may be removed while actively eating/drinking. Stu-
			dents who refuse to wear a mask in classrooms or labs will be
			required to leave the class and will be referred to the Dean of
			Students.

		<p>
			Social distancing of 3-feet is recommended.
			Residential students who have not uploaded their vaccination
			verification to MyChart are required to test weekly in the Ranger
			Hall Clinic.

		<p>
			Commuter students who come to campus at least once a week
			and have not uploaded their vaccination verification to MyChart
			are required to test bi-weekly in the Ranger Hall Clinic.
			If you have already been vaccinated please upload your record
			of vaccination to MyChart as soon as possible.

		<p>
				If you have not been vaccinated, here are several options:<br>

			<ul>
				<li> Call the Student Health & Counseling Center at (262) 595-
				2366 to schedule an appointment.</li>
				<li> Visit www.vaccines.gov (Links to an external site.) to locate a vaccine clinic near you.</li>
				<li> Do not come to class if you are feeling ill or experiencing
				COVID-19 symptoms. It is your responsibility to notify your
				instructor of any absences including any required periods
				of quarantine/isolation.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
				Based on our experience, COVID-19 infections were spread in
			higher-risk social activities such as parties, group gatherings
			without masks and appropriate social distancing, and travel
			rather than in the classroom. The best way to ensure an in-per-
			son experience with face-to-face classes and campus activities
			is to get vaccinated, wear your mask, and maintain appropriate
			social distancing.
